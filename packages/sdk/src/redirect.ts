 *     control — `/pricing` claiming `/pricing/v2` — so matching the control is not enough to
 *     prove this is the control page. Checked against every variant, not just one.
 *  2. **Arrived by redirect.** The handoff parameters in the URL say this page load *is* the
 *     result of this experiment's redirect. Survives a reload of the variant page, and works
 *     across origins where storage does not.
 *  3. **Already redirected this session.** A counter in `sessionStorage`, incremented before
 *     the redirect is issued, so even a decision that somehow repeats cannot bounce twice.
 *  4. **Target equals current URL.** The last resort: whatever the configuration says, never
 *     navigate to the page already being displayed.
