 * URL-based conversion goals.
 *
 * A conversion is a visitor who was in an experiment reaching the page the experiment counts
 * as success — typically a thank-you or order-confirmation page. Two conditions, both
 * required:
 *
 *  1. The current page matches the experiment's configured conversion URL.
 *  2. The visitor **already has an assignment** for that experiment.
 *
 * The second is what makes the number mean anything. Someone who reaches `/thank-you` without
 * ever having been bucketed did not convert *in this experiment* — they arrived by some other
 * path, and counting them would credit the experiment for traffic it never touched.
