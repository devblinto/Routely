/**
 * Optimistic authentication check (Next.js 16 renamed Middleware to Proxy).
 *
 * This is **not** the authorization boundary — `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` is, and it validates
 * the session against the database before any protected page renders. The Next.js docs warn
 * explicitly against using proxy as a session-management layer, and the reason applies here:
 * proxy runs in a lightweight runtime with no database access, so all it can see is whether a
 * session cookie is *present*, not whether it is valid.
 *
 * What it buys is worth having anyway:
 *
 *  - the visitor's intended destination is preserved in `?callbackUrl=`, which a layout
 *    cannot do because Server Components are not told the request path, and
 *  - an obviously-anonymous request is turned away before any rendering work happens.
 *
 * A forged or expired cookie gets past this check and is rejected by the layout a moment
 * later, which is the correct division of labour.

 * Auth.js prefixes the session cookie with `__Secure-` when it is issued over HTTPS, so both
