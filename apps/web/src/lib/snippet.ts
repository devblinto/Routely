 * requires the customer to touch their site again — which is the whole point of installing a
 * tag rather than editing pages.
 *
 * The snippet contains no secret. The public site id is an identifier that appears in page
 * source by design; it permits appending events to one website and nothing else.

 * The anti-flickering script.
 *
 * A redirect test races the network. The tracking tag is synchronous, so the SDK runs before
 * the page paints — but the *decision* needs the experiment configuration, and that is an HTTP
 * request. While it is in flight the browser paints the control page, so a visitor bound for
 * the variant sees the wrong page for as long as the request took.
 *
 * This script hides the page until the decision is made. It is deliberately **inline and
 * separate from the bundle**, which buys three things:
 *
 *  1. **It runs earlier than any bundle can.** There is no network request in front of it, so
 *     it takes effect at parse time even if the CDN is slow or the tag is moved lower.
 *  2. **The timings are the customer's.** The duration and the colour are plain values at the
 *     top of the script they paste, so a dark site or a slow host is a one-character edit on
 *     their own page — not a redeploy of ours, and not a value baked into a bundle every other
 *     customer shares.
 *  3. **It still lifts if the SDK never arrives.** The timeout belongs to this script, so a
 *     blocked, failed or missing bundle cannot leave a page hidden. That is the failure this
 *     whole mechanism has to be safe against: a cloak that never lifts is a blank site, which
 *     is far worse than the flicker it replaces.
 *
 * The SDK reveals the page early by calling `window.__routelyReveal()` as soon as it knows the
 * visitor is staying — so in the common case the overlay lasts only as long as the decision,
 * and the timeout is a backstop rather than the mechanism.
 *
 * Two details that look fussy and are not. Every declaration is `!important`, because the
 * customer's own stylesheets are linked *after* this element in document order and would
 * otherwise win on equal specificity. And the overlay is `position:fixed` rather than styles
 * applied to `body` itself — it then covers the viewport regardless of document height, and
 * the host page's box model never participates, so lifting it cannot reflow the page.
