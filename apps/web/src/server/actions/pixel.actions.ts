 * The check is a server-side fetch of a page the customer names, looking for the snippet in
 * the returned HTML. That is deliberately independent of whether any tracking data has
 * arrived: the SDK only reports events once an **active experiment matches the page being
 * viewed**, so a data-based check could not pass until a test already existed — which is the
 * wrong way round for a step whose whole job is confirming the install before that point.
 *
 * Whether data has arrived is still reported, as the second half of the picture rather than
 * the gate.
