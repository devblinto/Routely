 * Next.js hot-reloads server modules on every edit in development, so constructing the client
 * at module scope would leak a new connection pool per reload until Postgres refuses further
 * connections. Caching it on `globalThis` — which survives module reloads — avoids that; in

 * On a long-lived server one pool serves every request, and a larger pool is free throughput.

 * own pool, so the ceiling is `instances × max`, and a busy moment can exhaust Postgres'
 * `max_connections` long before it exhausts the machine.
 *
 * Hence one connection per instance in serverless. It is not a throughput limit in practice —
 * an instance handles one request at a time — and it is what makes a spike survivable. Point
 * `DATABASE_URL` at a pooler (PgBouncer, or Neon/Supabase's pooled port) as well; this setting
 * bounds the damage, the pooler is what actually multiplexes.
