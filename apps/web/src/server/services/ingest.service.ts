/**
 * Ingestion of events reported by the tracking SDK.
 *
 * This is the only write path reachable without a session, so nothing the client sends is
 * trusted as ownership:
 *
 *  - The **website** comes from the public site id, never from a field in the payload.
 *  - Every **experiment** is re-checked against that website. A payload naming an experiment
 *    on someone else's site is discarded, not stored.
 *  - Only **ACTIVE** experiments accept events, so a paused experiment stops recording
 *    immediately even from a browser still holding a cached configuration.
 *  - A claimed **variant id** must actually belong to the experiment it's reported against — a
 *    variant id is a real foreign key now, so unlike the old `"CONTROL" | "VARIANT"` literal, a
 *    forged or stale one could otherwise reference a variant of a *different* experiment and
 *    still satisfy the database's foreign-key constraint while being semantically wrong.
 *  - The **assignment** is read from the database, and the stored arm wins over whatever the
 *    client claims. A cleared cache or a tampered payload cannot move a visitor.
 *  - **URLs are normalised server-side.** The SDK normalises too, but a value that arrives
 *    over the network is an assertion, not a fact.
 *  - **Timestamps are clamped.** Browser clocks are routinely wrong by hours.
 *
 * A batch is processed event by event, and one bad event is dropped rather than failing the
 * request: a beacon cannot retry meaningfully, so partial acceptance loses less than refusal.

 * How close together two identical page views must be to count as one.
