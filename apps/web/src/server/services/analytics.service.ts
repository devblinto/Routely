/**
 * Read-only analytics for an experiment.
 *
 * Every function takes `actorUserId` and resolves the experiment through the ownership chain
 * first, so a caller cannot read another customer's results by supplying an id — the same rule
 * as everywhere else, applied to reads that are otherwise easy to treat as harmless.
 *
 * Page views, visitor counts, approximate visible time and conversions are computed here.
 *
 * ## Visible time is approximate
 *
 * `avgVisibleMs` is derived from what a browser is willing to report, which is document
 * visibility — not attention. A tab left open on a monitor nobody is looking at counts; a
 * person reading carefully while the window sits behind another may not. Time after the last
 * beacon is lost entirely, so a crash or a force-quit truncates the measurement silently, and
 * that truncation is more likely on slower devices.
 *
 * It is meaningful **as a comparison between the arms of one experiment**, because all of them
 * are measured the same way and the bias is shared. It is not a session-duration figure, and
 * presenting it as one — or comparing it against a number from another tool — would be wrong.
 * The UI must label it as approximate wherever it appears.
