/**
 * Checking whether the tracking snippet is actually on a customer's page.
 *
 * This fetches a URL the customer supplies, which makes it a server-side request forgery
 * vector by construction: without limits it is a general-purpose "make the Routely server
 * request this for me" endpoint, reachable from any signed-in account. Four constraints keep
 * it narrow, and each covers something the others do not:
 *
 *  1. **Same-site.** The URL must be on the website's own registered domain, reusing the same
 *     `isSameSite` rule experiments are held to. That alone limits an attacker to hosts they
 *     have already claimed as theirs.
 *  2. **No private address space** (production only). A domain is just a name, and
 *     `169.254.169.254` or an internal host is perfectly registrable — so the resolved address
 *     is checked, not the name. Skipped in development because local testing runs against
 *     hosts like `mysite.local` that resolve to loopback by design.
 *  3. **Redirects are followed manually**, re-validating every hop. Following automatically
 *     would let a compliant first response bounce the request somewhere the checks above just
 *     rejected.
 *  4. **Bounded time and size**, so a slow or enormous response cannot tie up the server.
