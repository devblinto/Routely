 * The authorization boundary for the entire dashboard.

 * Gating happens here — in a Server Component that runs before any child renders — rather
 * than in `proxy.ts`, because proxy runs on cached and prefetched requests too and the
 * Next.js docs explicitly warn against treating it as a session-management layer. Pages that
 * load user data still call `requireUser()` in their service calls, so authorization is
 * enforced at the data layer as well and never depends on the layout alone.
