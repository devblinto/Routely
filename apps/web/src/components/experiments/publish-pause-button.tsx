 * The single most useful lifecycle action for a given status, as a compact list control.
 *
 * A draft or a paused experiment publishes; a running one pauses; an archived one offers
 * nothing, because ARCHIVED is terminal. Anything more (archiving, going back to draft) lives
 * on the experiment's own page — a list row is the wrong place to make a decision that needs
 * context.
 *
 * A failure — most often the "another experiment already targets this control URL" conflict —
 * is shown inline here, because sending the user to another page to read why a one-click
 * action failed would lose their place in the list.
