/**
 * Confirmation before deleting an experiment.
 *
 * Deletion cascades to every assignment, event and conversion recorded under the experiment,
 * so the dialog names what is actually lost. For an experiment that has collected results,
 * archiving is offered as the alternative in the copy — it keeps the data and simply stops
 * collecting more, which is what most people reaching for "delete" on a finished test want.
 *
 * The form is rendered outside the dialog and the confirm button is associated with it by
 * `form=`, matching `DeleteWebsiteDialog`: Radix portals dialog content and only mounts it
 * while open, so a nested form would exist only transiently.
