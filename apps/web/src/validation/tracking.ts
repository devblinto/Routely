 * These describe data arriving from an untrusted browser on a public, unauthenticated
 * endpoint, so every field is bounded: batch size, string lengths, and timestamp range. A
 * payload that fails here is discarded rather than partially applied.
 *
 * `EventType` is derived from the Prisma enum, which uses the same literal strings the SDK
 * sends, so a wire value maps to a column value with no translation step. `variantId` has no
 * equivalent enum to derive from — it's a real id (or `null` for control) checked for shape
 * only; ownership (does it belong to *this* experiment) is verified in the ingestion service,
 * which is the layer that actually has the experiment's variant list to check it against.
